# continue is not used much but it is still good to know what it does. In short it will skip
# a iteration of a loop.

for letter in "Python":
   if letter == "h":
      continue
   print("Current Letter:" + letter)

# what will happen here is that when letter equals the letter h, the next iteration will start
# run this code snippet to see what happens for yourself.
